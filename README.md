# IRC Project Implementation Roadmap

This is an IRC project using C

## Phase 1: Basic Server Setup

1. Create a TCP socket server that accepts connections
2. Implement client connection handling
3. Add simple text message exchange between server and client
4. Basic logging of connections and messages

## Phase 2: User Management

1. Implement user registration (nickname selection)
2. Track connected users in a data structure
3. Handle user disconnections gracefully
4. Add username uniqueness enforcement

## Phase 3: Simple Commands

1. Create command processing framework
2. Implement `/nick` for changing nicknames
3. Implement `/quit` for disconnecting
4. Add `/help` for listing available commands

## Phase 4: Messaging Features

1. Enable private messaging between users (`/msg`)
2. Implement server broadcasts for important events
3. Add user-to-user direct messaging
4. Create message formatting utilities

## Phase 5: Channel Basics

1. Implement channel data structures
2. Add channel creation with `/join`
3. Enable channel messaging
4. Implement `/part` to leave channels

## Phase 6: Channel Management

1. Track channel membership
2. Add channel topics with `/topic`
3. Implement channel user lists via `/names`
4. Create channel broadcasting mechanism

## Phase 7: User Privileges

1. Implement channel operator status
2. Add kicking users with `/kick`
3. Implement banning with `/ban`
4. Add mode settings for channels and users

## Phase 8: Advanced Features

1. Implement connection persistence
2. Add message history/backlog
3. Create file transfer capabilities
4. Implement server-side scripting or plugins

## Phase 9: Security & Optimization

1. Add user authentication
2. Implement SSL/TLS for connections
3. Optimize for handling many simultaneous users
4. Advanced memory management and leak prevention

## Phase 10: Network Extensions

1. Server-to-server communication
2. Server clustering/federation
3. Bot API framework
4. Service integration capabilities

## Expected Behavior

When complete, your IRC project will allow users to:

- Connect to the server from multiple clients simultaneously
- Register with unique nicknames
- Join, create, and leave chat channels
- Send messages to channels or directly to other users
- Manage channels as operators (kick, ban, set topics)
- Transfer files securely between users
- Connect through encrypted connections
- Experience stable performance even with many users
- Potentially connect to other IRC networks via server federation
